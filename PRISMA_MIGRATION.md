🔹 What happens when you just update schema.prisma and run prisma db push?

prisma db push synchronizes your database schema with the schema.prisma file.

It does not generate a migration history – it just makes your database match the schema.

If you push the updated schema file to Git and your teammates run prisma db push, their database will also get updated.
✅ That’s why you’re seeing changes reflect on their DB.

🔹 What happens with prisma migrate dev?

prisma migrate dev creates a migration file (SQL script) that records the exact change.

This migration file is committed to Git and shared with the team.

When teammates run prisma migrate dev (or prisma migrate deploy in production), the migration history is applied step by step.
✅ This ensures everyone’s DB schema evolves consistently across environments.
❌ Without migrations, you might lose track of what changed when (esp. in prod).

🔹 Why are migrations important?

Team Sync:
With migrations, your teammates don’t need to guess what changed – they just apply the migration file.

Production Safety:
In production, you should never run db push because it may cause destructive changes without warning.
Example: Dropping a column and losing data.

Version Control:
Migrations provide a history of schema evolution (like Git for your DB).

Rollback / Debugging:
You can check past migrations to see when and why a column/table was added/changed.

🔹 Best Practice in Teams

During development:
👉 Use prisma migrate dev (creates migration + updates local DB).
👉 Commit migration files (/prisma/migrations/...).

For teammates:
👉 They pull the latest code and run prisma migrate dev (or prisma migrate deploy for prod).
👉 Their DB updates consistently with yours.

Only use db push for quick prototyping or resetting local DBs.

✅ Summary:

Technically, if you all just use db push, it works for local development.

But in team + production environments, you should use migrations so schema changes are tracked, safe, and reproducible.









🔹 Step-by-Step Workflow for Teams
1. One developer makes a schema change

Suppose you add a column to a model in schema.prisma:

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

2. Generate a migration

Run:

npx prisma migrate dev --name add-user-table


This will:

Create a migration folder under prisma/migrations/202508281230_add-user-table/.

Apply the change to your local database.

Update schema.prisma and prisma/migrations.

✅ You now have both the schema + migration tracked in Git.

3. Commit & push

Commit and push both:

schema.prisma

prisma/migrations/** (all migration files)

git add prisma/schema.prisma prisma/migrations
git commit -m "Add User table"
git push origin main

4. Teammates pull the changes

When others pull your changes:

git pull origin main

5. Teammates apply the migration

They run:

npx prisma migrate dev


This will:

Apply the same SQL migration to their local DB.

Keep everyone’s schema identical.

6. For production

When deploying:

npx prisma migrate deploy


This:

Applies all pending migrations (but does not generate new ones).

Ensures production matches the schema history.

🔹 Rules of Thumb

Never commit only schema.prisma without a migration — otherwise teammates will be forced to db push and risk inconsistencies.

Never use prisma db push in production — it can cause destructive changes.

Always run prisma migrate dev locally after making schema changes.

Always commit migration files with your schema changes.

Use migrate deploy in production pipelines, not migrate dev.

🔹 Example Workflow

Sahil: Updates schema → runs migrate dev → commits schema + migration.

Teammates: Pull → run migrate dev → DB matches Sahil’s DB.

Deployment: CI/CD runs migrate deploy → prod DB updated safely.

👉 This way, your DB schema is versioned just like your codebase — no surprises, no accidental data loss.
